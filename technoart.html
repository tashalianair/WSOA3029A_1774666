            <p>Sabine Roeser focuses their essay on the way in which ‘techno-art’ can be used as a means of providing a different perspective in 
                the debates regarding technological risks. They explain that a large part of the reason behind why these debates occur so frequently 
                are because it is a reflection of the “deeply rooted mistrust of risky technologies and a problem of legitimacy in democratic society” 
                (Roeser, 2016). The concerns around the ethics and morals and the necessity around some technologies is not completely unfounded. 
                Technology is not a neutral invention, it is imbued with this bias’s of those who create it and often time, even though the intention 
                behind creating certain technologies was not malicious or have any intention to be harmful, they could still have harmful consequences on others simply because of the bias that people have that have caused an oversight</p>

            </br>
            <p>Roeser defines techno-art as “art that reflects on and engages with risky technologies” (Roeser, 2016), explaining that a number of artists 
                practice their art in this manners, often exploring the possibilities of this space as well as engaging with more controversial aspects of 
                newer technology. The concept of techno-art is not a new one and has been practiced by many throughout history. Roeser mentions 
                Leonardo da Vinci as one artist who engaged with scientific and technological developments in his art as well as his other practices. 
                Dystopian novels are another form of techno-art that Roeser mentions, as they speak to the possible risks of technological developments 
                but do so by exercising imagination and creativity to build entirely altered societies or to build worlds in which these technological 
                developments could be possible. Works like Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein speak to the consequences of 
                technology and have “shaped people’s suspicions towards, for example, cloning and human enhancement” (Roeser, 2016). On the other hand, 
                utopian novels, the focus on the celebration of the advancement in technological development are also an example of techno-art, for they 
                also seek to open or create a discourse on the impacts of technology on society. Science fiction works are also an example of techno-art. 
                Roeser explains that they deal with both uptopian and dystopian views on the possible implications of technology on society, prompting 
                reflection and opening a discourse on the ethics of these advancements through aesthetics and utilising the imaginative and emotional 
                capacities of the audience (Roeser, 2016).</p></p>
                </br>
            <p>In more contemporary techno-art Roeser explains that the new technologies that we have and that are being explored open up a whole new 
                world in terms of the variety of topics that can be explored and the variety in terms of the types of art that can be created. </p>
                </br>
            <p>Roeser uses the example of performance artist Stelarc who, in 2007, was working on exploring the points in which bio-art, robotics art 
                and ICT-art intersect. Using his own body for his experiment, he attached a third ear to his arm through surgery and cell-cultivation, 
                partially using his own stem cells. He would then eventually there would be a microphone and a wireless connection to the internet that 
                would be implanted into the ear. Stelarc explains his idea on his website stating, “For example, someone in Venice could listen to what 
                my ear is hearing in Melbourne. […] Another alternate function […] is the idea of the ear as part of an extended and distributed Bluetooth 
                system. […] This additional and enabled EAR ON ARM effectively becomes an Internet organ for the body”</p></p>
            </br>
            <p>Through this experiment, Stelarc explores the realm of stem cell research and enhancement by going to certain lengths and even approaching 
                the concepts in ways that contemporary scientists would not usually. By deploying his imaginative and provocative way, thinking about and 
                practicing this field of thought outside conventional norm, exploring the legal and ethical boundaries of this fiels of research. Though 
                EAR ON ARM doesn’t have a particular purpose that everyone can make use of, the experiment “explores conceptual and normative issues, for 
                example the meaning of connectedness in an age of hyperconnectivity” (Roeser, 2016). </p>
            </br>
            <p>Roeser explains that techno-art works as a means of concretising the concepts and the concerns that are being discussed in the debates 
                around technological developments by means of offering different perspectives and to show these concepts in vivid images and narratives. 
                Doing this also allows for a wider audience to be able to engage in this discourse and conceptualises the discourse in a way that is more 
                accessible. Art as a whole allows for growth in our ethical and political thinking, techno-art differ from the more traditional art but 
                give rise to different philosophical questions like “which aspects of technological risk are addressed in the artwork? Which moral values 
                are involved in the technology exemplified or used in the artwork? How does the artwork address or highlight these values?” (Roeser, 2016). 
                Art also elicits emotional responses from those who engage with it, Roeser questions what role emotional responses have in ethical reflection 
                that is caused by works of techno-art and what values and concerns do these emotions reveal and how do we then go about addressing them. 
                Roeser states then that techno-art can provide deeper insights into ethical aspects of new technologies by way of them providing a space 
                where in-depth studies and normative-ethical reflection on the emotions and aesthetic and reflective experiences of these art-works</p>
            </br>
            <p>Roeser explores the challenges that techno-art faces. One of them being that while the art-works are meant to inspire emotional responses 
                and elicit thoughts and reflection on risky technologies, techno-art might fail at trying to achieve this because the concepts could be 
                too difficult for people to grasp, they could be manipulative or focus on unrealistic scenarios. Another concern that is that the artistic 
                aesthetics and merits are at risk of not being understood or seen. Roeser also states that it is difficult to ensure that artists have 
                artistic freedom when creating their works and simultaneously contributing meaningfully to ethical reflection and maintaining within the 
                bounds of scientific and legal constraints. </p>
