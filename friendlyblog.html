            <h1 style = "text-align: center;"><u><b>A brief history of data visualisation</b></u></h1>
        </br>
            <p>In the book titled Handbook of Computational Statistics: Data Visualization, Michael Friendly wrote a chapter titled, A brief 
                history of data visualization, in which the intellectual history of data visualisation is explored and explained, starting 
                in medieval times and ending in the modern day.</p>
            <p>Prior to the 17th century, some of the earliest forms of visualisation were done to map positions of the stars and celestial 
                bodies or were to create maps to aid in navigation and exploration. Some of these methods were developed in Egypt, as far 
                back as 200 BC, whereby they had developed a coordinate system similar to longitude and latitude to log the layouts of towns 
                and to map the positions of stars and celestial bodies. </p>
            </br>
            <p>From the 10th century comes one of the earliest depictions of quantitative information in which an anonymous author used to 
                chart the changing positions of the seven most prominent heavenly bodies over space and time using multiple time-series graph. 
                By the 14th century, the concept of plotting theoretical functions and recognising the logical relationship between tabulating 
                values and plotting them. And by the 16th century, the techniques and methods were more refined and well developed, allowing for 
                more precise observation and measurement of physical quantities and geographical and celestial bodies. </p>
            </br>
            <p>By the 17th century, issues regarding physical measurement in terms of time, distance and space for the purposes of navigation, 
                astronomy, map making and surveying. It brought about the dawn of analytical geometry and coordinate systems and theories of 
                measurement and estimation. In the 1600s in countries around Europe, began with the systematic collection an subsequent study 
                of social data with the intentions of reporting on matters concerned with wealth, population, agriculture and taxes. </p>
            </br>
            <p>In the 17th century saw the foundation of statistical theory, data of interest and importance as well as the concept of graphic 
                representation but the 18th century saw growth and development in these fields. Map making became more sophisticated, depicting 
                a wider range of information as well as the spreading of the use of abstract graphs and with this, the birth of statistical theory 
                and the systematic collection of empirical data. The use of graphs and other such graphical representations to depict data as well 
                as the methods by which to create and disseminate these depictions of information were further developed throughout the 18th 
                century. </p>
            </br>
            <p>The 1850s to the 1900s were considered to be the Golden Age of statistical graphics. During this time a multitude of advancements 
                in not only methods of visualisation were made but also advancements in the appearance of these depictions. Florence Nightingale 
                was credited with the invention of the rose diagrams or the coxcombs which were created and used in an effort to improve sanitary 
                conditions in the battlefield treatment of soldiers.  The advancements in the depictions of maps as well as the concept of charting 
                data on a map was done during times of cholera outbreaks in 1845 by Dr. John Snow, plotting the locations of those who had died from 
                cholera allowed for determining the location of the source of the outbreak. The collection, organisation and dissemination of government 
                statistic on populace, commerce, social, moral, and political issues also became widespread during this time. The data graphics were 
                published largely in European countries. </p>
            </br>
            <p>From 1900 to 1950 is to be considered the modern dark ages. This is because during this time, the enthusiasm and the innovation that 
                permeated so much of the Golden Age had come to a halt, and there were either no or very few advancements and innovations made. 
                From the 1950s to 1975, there was a resurgence of data visualisation developments. Three significant developments took place namely 
                the demand for data analysis to be considered as a legitimate branch of statistics that was separate from the fields of mathematic 
                related statistics, the publishing of Semiolgie Graphique which was said to organsie the visual and perceptual elements of graphics 
                in terms of their features and relations to data and lastly the dawn of computer processing statistical data as well as the 
                development of interactive statistical applications. </p>
            </br>
            <p>From 1975 to the present day and with growth and development in computing technology and the rise of the internet, the focus of has 
                been to create general systems that can create dynamic and interactive graphics that are capable of manipulating and analysing data. </p>
