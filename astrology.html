                <h1>about moon lake</h1>
                <p>
                    Moon Lake was made with the intention of creating a space that provides an array of astrological themed information. My 
                    goal with regards to this is to be able to have different branches of astrology and other such practices included in the 
                    website and have information that would either be on the website itself or direct the users to places that do have it and 
                    explain it well. I would like to include more apart from the two (the widget and the moon calendar visualisation) 
                </p>
            </br>
                <p>
                    For the second assignment, I wanted to be able to be able to show more of the astrological aspect of the theme I have made use 
                    of a widget that helps the user calculate their natal or birth chart. I did not code this, I fear the calculations as well as 
                    the process behind accessing the data to create the map is a bit beyond my capabilities. The natal chart widget is on the website 
                    purely as a means to further add to the theme and hopefully, by the exam, there will be others like that (unless i am advise against 
                    this) as well as other types of information such as tarot card descriptions, important dates or periods of time that are coming up
                    and other such things. 
                </p>
            </br>
                <p>
                    In terms of the technical aspect of the website, I have struggled to keep up with work let alone understand some of the 
                    concepts. I am not proficient in javascript and have struggled with trying to create the visualisations. I did make the 
                    mistake of using Chart.js and not D3.js and that is a fault of mine and I do strongly hope that by the time the exam is due,
                    I will have been able to properly create the required graphs and visualisations required of me.
