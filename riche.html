            <h1 style = "text-align: center;"><u><b>A close reading of Riche et al: Nicholas Diakopoulos: Ethics in Data-Driven Visual Storytelling</b></u></h1>
            <p>In the chapter titled ¬Ethics in Data-Driven Visual Storytelling, Nicholas Diakopoulos discusses the ethical considerations that should be taken when designing data visualisations. 
                Diakopoulos defines ethics to be something that is “concerned with articulating apt behaviour and conduct”, quoting a journalism ethics scholar, Stephan Ward, who further explains 
                that ethics is “the study and practice of what constitutes the best regulation of human conduct, individually and socially” (Riche et al., 2018). </p>
            </br>
            <p>Diakopoulos explains that principles can be used as guidelines when it comes to making decisions around ethics. Three of these principles are mentioned:</p>
            <p>1) “Seek truth and report it as fully as possible.”</p>
            <p>2) “Be transparent.”</p>
            <p>3) “Engage community as an end, rather than as a means.”</p>
            </br>
            <h4>Seek truth and report it as fully as possible</h4>
            </br>
            <p>This principle holds a great deal of significance when it comes to “data stories” (Riche et al., 2018), because there are “many possibilities to mislead, misinform, obfuscate, or even 
                deceive using visualization” (Riche et al., 2018). Data is always susceptible to misinterpretations, intentional or otherwise, and can always be manipulated to achieve the collectors 
                needs at any point from the collection of the data, to the ways in which it is quantified, normalised, aggregated, filtered, visually encoded, annotated and made to be interactive 
                (Riche et al., 2018). </p>
            </br>
            <h4>Be transparent</h4>
            </br>
            <p>The second principle has more to do with the ways in which the information obtained from the data that was collected, is found and interpreted It is important for the storytellers who 
                are using the data to create their stories and visualisations are able to “trace and disclose their rationale and process,” for how they arrived at the interpretations they have.</p>
            </br>
            <h4>Engage community as an end, rather than as a means</h4>
            <p>The third principle is centred around the ways in which the people who are represented in these data sets are treated with dignity, humanity and respect. They should be viewed in this 
                way and not as another tool in order to obtain data and to be represented in some way in a visualisation. Their treatment should not be sacrificed for the sake of telling a story. 
                This principle is also concerned with interactivity and the ways in which, by using interactive elements and interactivity, can be used to engage communities as opposed to having the 
                data dictated to them, they can interact and engage with visualisations. </p>
            </br>
            <h4>Data acquisition</h4>
            </br>
            <p> Diakopoulos states that knowing the origins of the data in terms of the reasons it was collected, by who was it collected, is it complete and representative of the time. He explains 
                that this is essential to create “informative and truthful data narratives” (Riche et al., 2018). The data should always be cited and listed, especially if there are some elements 
                about its cultivation that do not seems entirely ethical, however it becomes a question of, even if the responsibility for the unethical elements or nature of the collection of the 
                data falls of those who collected it, should it even be used by others even if it can help in creating data narratives. The concern is that the purposes of the collection of the data 
                will impact whatever it is used for. Diakopoulos also warns that the collectors of the data “may have a stake in misinforming, distracting, or promoting a version of the truth that 
                may be at odds with the public interest” (Riche et al., 2018) or worse still if the data was obtained illegally, it could discredit the work you are trying to do. This caution needs 
                to be practised especially in the present era of data collection in which data is being intentionally manipulated for  purposes centred around favourably positioning their own 
                organisations or to create free promotion for the business or company and so on. Diakopoulos pushes for need to understand the why’s and how’s around data collection and creation, 
                the ways in which politics affects collection and understanding whether or not certain data sets should be used once you know all of this information. </p>
            </br>
            <h4>Quantification</h4>
            <p>The manner in which “the world is measured and turned into data” (Riche et al., 2018) is something that Diakopoulos states is an interesting ethical consideration that should be 
                thought of when discussing how the world is sampled and how individual data is measured but more importantly, how are measurements defined and how to avoid ambiguity. Nothing is 
                truly universal especially with regards to the ways in which process, collect and define measurements and data and what they would consider to be ambiguous or not. Diakopoulos states 
                it is incredibly important to understand the definitions so that data will not be lost and or misconstrued and misinterpreted. He says that once we “put a rule to the world we cannot 
                help but lose information and context in the creation of data,” (Riche et al., 2018) and this further prompts contemplation around whether the data that is collected is truthful and 
                accurate and whether it allows for the stories created with it to be “faithful to reality”, posing the questions of “Are we really measuring what we mean to measure?” 
                (Riche et al., 2018).</p>
            </br>
            <p>When discussing matters around race, ethnicity, crime, education and unemployment, this concept of what counts and what is considered important matters greatly. In this chapter, 
                Diakopoulos uses the example of the Chicago police department with regards to the definition of power. He explains how between the years of 2010 to 2013, the department had managed 
                to reduce the rate of 8 index crimes by 56%, however the Chicago Magazine conducted and investigative report on the this, stating that the numbers were simply too good to be true, 
                only to find that the stats had been manipulated or “rinsed and washed” by means of misclassify an downgrade offenses so they would not count towards the eight index crimes. With 
                the way that they have manipulated and doctored the information, it is impossible for the narratives that they’ve created to be truthful or honest or credible. Understanding the 
                social and political pressures on the crime quantification process in Chicago can also explain the creation of and collection of the data. </p>
            </br>
            <h4>Data Transformation</h4>
            </br>
            <p>Randall Munroe depicts the core issues with non-population-normalised mapping is that by displaying the data on a choropleth map will show hot spots in areas of high population. 
                Therefore, in some places like urban areas, where there is a greater population density will be shown to be hot spots purely on the basis of having more people in that area as 
                opposed having the map be a reflection of the data. A way in which this can be remedied is to divide by the population in the area that is mapped thereby transforming the variable 
                mapped to a population-normalised value. </p>
            <p>Normalisation, though a potential solution, comes with its own potential issues, ones that affect the “insight or story” that readers will interpret. Diakopoulos explains that for
                 different types of data sets, in order to tell communicate effectively. Diakopoulos states that a way to manage ethical decisions regarding the normalisation of data is to have 
                 the visualisations be interactive in some way, giving “the end-user more freedom to make this decision on their own terms.” (ref). Aside from this, interactivity creates 
                 opportunities to explore various types of normalisation and the ways in which they impact the readers interpretation of the story presented to them. </p>
            </br>
            <h4>Aggregation</h4>
            </br>
            <p>When using aggregated data, data that is collected through mathematical operations or combinations, Diakopoulos explains that it is preferred that a consistent form of aggregation 
                is applied to data that is being visually compared. For example, as Diakopoulos explains, when creating histograms, bin widths for aggregating values should be made consistent so 
                that "visual comparisons are made according to commensurate aggregations." (Riche et al., 2018). It is important to make sure that the operations that are used in order to aggregate 
                different data sets, that these uses are meaningful and that they make the values easy to interpret.</p>
            </br>
            <h4>Algorithmic derivation </h4>
            </br>
            <p>More sophisticated algorithms, apart from normalisation and aggregation are used to derive data. However, these algorithms come with challenges and concerns of their own. 
                Diakopoulos uses a case that occurred in 2009, the Los Angels police department was notified that their public crime mapping system was producing errors, only to discover that when 
                the geocoder could not locate the address where a crime had taken place, it would assign a random location, making it seem as though that random area was now a crime hotspot. It is 
                imperative to understand that working algorithmically is not to say that there will be no errors or ethical implications to the way that the data is derived. Nothing made by people 
                is free from bias or error and this should be taken into consideration. It is important to be able to understand the errors that a system is giving you and actively work towards 
                mitigating the effect that those errors have on the readers understanding and interpretation of the story. </p>
            </br>
            <h4>Filtering </h4>
            </br>
            <p>Filtering is considered to be an essential operation when it comes to creating "successful data-driven" storytelling. Filtering has both positive and negative sides, the one being 
                that while filtering does allow for zeroing in on the more important aspects of a data set and as a way of making the data set as tailored to your specific needs, it can also be 
                used in, what Diakoloupos refers to as, “cherry-picking”, selecting the data that supports the claims, beliefs and opinions or that somehow benefits the person who is using the 
                data. Manipulating data so as to frame your story as something that is truthful and credible is unethical and the spreading of doctored data representations and visualisations 
                can be dangerous. The question of whether the understanding and interpretation of the visualisations are greatly impacted by the act of filtering data.</p>
            </br>
            <h4>Anonymisation </h4>
            </br>
            <p>Anonymisation brings important concerns to the forefront when dealing with personal information and what should be considered ethical and unethical as well highlighting the tensions 
                that exist between personal privacy issues and public interest. Diakopoulos uses the example of there being a distinct difference between having the criminal record of something 
                running for some kind of political position (mayor, minister, president, etc.), the same standards might not apply for regular people. Especially when taken in the context of someone 
                with a minor charge that they were wrongly accused of in their youth, can now not find gainful employment because their records are public versus the community trying to obtain a list 
                of convicted sex offenders living in that community. </p>
            </br>
            <h4>Conveying and connecting insights </h4>
            </br>
            <p>There are many ways in which data can be mapped in order to distort it and mislead the viewer and these are things people must be made aware of and actively avoid when making their 
                visualisations. The spacing of data in visualisations in and important factor to be considered because of the ways in which people can use the range of their axes to effectively 
                hide data or squash data or even to enlarge it, visually leading viewers to believe the value of the something is far greater than that of the other things being marked on the 
                visualisation. Having your axes be inappropriately ranged can lead to greater exaggerations of data values, leading people to believe and interpret and respond to the data differently. </p>
            </br>
            <h4>Implied relationships </h4>
            </br>
            <p>Relationships or implied relationships and correlations between data can be fabricated and manipulated through the ways in which the data is represented, even if these data sets have 
                little to nothing to do with the other. Through this, certain phenomena can be depicted as being related and having their relationship be causal or having two very different and 
                unrelated groups of data be said to have great impacts on the other. </p>
            <p>The human mind is prone to filling in casual explanations when we engage with a story or a narrative of some kind and because of this, it is important to understand the ways in which 
                these representations can appear to be linked or the ways in which they could be interpreted as connected whether or not that was your intention. </p>
            </br>
            <h4>Context and Annotation</h4>
            </br>
            <p>Diakopoulos explains that data are not facts but rather “givens” in which a range of interpretations can be derived, something he links to the meaning of the word data is derived from 
                which means “something given”.  Interpretations and understandings of data sets in very heavily linked and connected and influenced by the ways in which the data is presented to the 
                viewers as well as how it is presented in relation to other information and data. </p>

            <p>In data visualisations, annotations and labels are important in communicating details to the viewers and adding further understanding and increasing readability of the data. Annotations 
                can “emphasize, highlight, or prioritize particular pieces of data or interpretations, aiding in the storytelling process by directing attention or preempting the user’s curiosity.”</p>
            </br>
            <p>From an ethical standpoint, annotations and labels are meant to increase understanding, providing context that is relevant to the visualisations without distracting and guiding the user 
                to the most plausible, logical and faithful interpretation of the data. They should be done with care so they can be presented in a straightforward manner, leaving little to no room 
                for misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the data to be achieved. </p>
            </br>
            <h4>Interactivity</h4>
            </br>
            <p>Interactive visualisations can be a means of providing the viewer with agency as they navigate the visualisation. Having some form of interactivity, allowing for viewers to “navigate, 
                search, and filter the data” according to their own interests creates a deeper relevance and personalisation of the experience with the viewer. It is important to understand that important 
                data should not be hidden or obscured or lying in wait for the viewer to engage in some way before revealing itself. You must take great care in trying to determine what will be your 
                default values and how best to communicate your narrative upon first contact because not everyone will engage with the interactive elements.</p>
