            <h1 style = "text-align: center;"><u><b>A close reading of Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic: Chapter 1: The Importance of Context</b></u></h1>
            <h4>Exploratory vs explanatory</h4>
        </br>
        <p>Exploratory analysis is what is done to understand the data and determine what is interesting or noteworthy, it is often about the quality of the information that is there, focusing 
            the other data around those focal points in order to truly communicate the narrative or the story you are trying to. </p>
        </br>
        <h4>Who, what and how</h4>
        </br>
        <p>You need to ask yourself questions before creating your visualisations, so as to help yourself narrow down what is important, what will aide in the understanding and communication of 
            those important points and how best to depict that data. “To whom are you communicating?”: it is important that you know who you are communicating with and know how they will 
            perceive you. Knowing this can help you establish common ground that will help you better connect with your audience so they are more likely to engage with your work. “What do you 
            want your audience to know or do?”: be clear on how you want your audience to react to your visualisations, taking into account the ways in which you communicate to them and the tone 
            that that communication will take. The last question is “How can you use data to help make your point?”, something which can only be answered after the first have been answered. </p>
        </br>
        <h4>Who</h4>
        </br>
        <h5>Audience: </h5>
        </br>
        <p>More specificity is best when thinking about your audience because it will help you to better position your work in a way that will draw out the best possible response from them. 
            Avoid general audience and broad categories of people because it will be difficult to find the things that will create interest and connection between your work and your audience. 
            By trying to appeal to too many people with varying interests you “put yourself in a position where you can’t communicate to any one of them as effectively as you could have.”</p>
        </br>
        <h5>You:</h5>
        </br>
        <p>It is important to also understand the relationship you have with your audience and your expectations in terms of the ways in which they wil perceive you. Consider your relationship 
            with that audience and by understanding that, you can work to better position not only your work but also yourself.</p>
        </br>
        <h4>What</h4>
        </br>
        <h5>Action:</h5>
        <p>You need to understand what it is you want your audience to understand, take away or do when encountering your work. This will help with forming a clear understanding of how to make 
            your work relevant to your audience and finding ways to make it so they care about what you have to say with your work. “You should always want your audience to know something,” and 
            this is why it is imperative to know exactly the ways in which to capture and retain their attention</p>
        </br>
        <h5>Mechanism:</h5>
        </br>
        <p>How will you communicate to your audience? An important question to answer as the method you use to communicate has multiple implications including in terms of the amount of control 
            you have over how the audience interprets the data and the amount of detail that needs to be explicitly presented to the audience. You need to know what your “primary communication 
            vehicle” will be, whether live presentation, written document or something else. Understanding this will give you a better grasp on what you need to show and how much information needs 
            to be visual and if any of it needs to spoken and so on. </p>
        </br>
        <h5>Tone:</h5>
        </br>
        <p>It is important to know the tone of the information you are trying to communicate, is it a serious discussion, more light-hearted, celebratory? Knowing this will help you better 
            determine how to communicate your information and will help you better prepare for the environment it will be presented in. </p>
        </br>
        <h5>How:</h5>
        </br>
        <p>“What data is available that will help make my point?” is a question that one must answer because data is the backbone of your visualisations and is, essentially, the thing that 
            holds everything together and gives the visualisations a purpose.</p>
