            <h1 style = "text-align: center;"><u><b>A close reading of Liisa Janssens: Freedom and Data Profiling</b></u></h1>
            <p><i>“Algorithms normally behave as they’re designed, quietly trading stocks or, in the case of Amazon, pricing books according to supply and demand. But left unsupervised, 
                algorithms can and will do strange things. As we put more and more of our world under control of algorithms, we can lose track of who -- or what -- is pulling the strings”</i></p>
            <p>Christopher Steiner</p>
            </br>
            <p>Algorithms play an increasingly large role in the things that we do, the ways in which we are perceived and the way in which the things we engage with on a daily basis work. 
                Liisa Janssens asks the question of “What would happen if a set of algorithms could identify behaviour and possibly even our thoughts?” (Janssens, 2016: pp1). Algorithms like 
                these would drastically impact the ways our interactions and relationships as human beings are defined. In the present day, algorithms that we encounter on a daily basis could 
                create profiles of us all based on what we do. They could create a surface-level version of you purely based on the data that they have collected based on your activity, 
                reducing you only to this. Janssens states that there is a danger here that the definition of what it means to be a person could change based on the perceptions of the data 
                collected about you, only to be seen “through conceptions which follow from a system that is guided by probability analyses,” (Janssens, 2016: pp1). Janssens poses the question 
                of whether or not human beings can be categorised in this way, on the basis of their data profiles, or whether “man, as ‘the Other’ also hides a mystery which reaches further 
                than these analyses can reach.” (Janssens, 2016: pp1).</p>
            </br>
            <p>We should always remain aware of who makes and controls these algorithms, the flaws and errors of these algorithms and the extent to which these occur in the process of 
                programming and whether or not such errors and flaws are able to be detected. When combing through datasets it should always be brought into question, the methodology which 
                was used to collect the data and the reasoning behind it and the nature of it. </p>
            </br>
            <h4>Increase in Data Streams Will Usher in a ‘Hyperconnected Era’</h4>
            </br>
            <p>Technology firms are constantly expanding their methods and their means of collecting data, and in light of their great successes in doing so, they are rarely ever questioned 
                in terms of why this is necessary, what purpose does this fulfil and so on. This, in part, is due to the “level of difficulty of the ethical questions into positions the 
                possibilities that sets of algorithms provide for analysing data,” (Janssens, 2016: pp1-2). The fundamental rights and freedoms, as Janssens explains, are still protected to 
                some degree when it comes to privacy provisions in laws and regulations, however, this does little in the way of regulating or at the very least posing ethical questions around 
                the collection of big data. The collection of big data is not something that is contained within the borders of a single country, it is a global issue and because of that and 
                the varying laws regarding data collection and privacy and laws regarding the internet and its usage, this is something that is difficult to regulate or tackle. </p>
            </br>
            <p>The great value place on data companies, illustrated in the acquisition of Whatsapp by Facebook for 22 billion US dollars, shows that acquisitions such as these happen primarily 
                as profit for both buyers and sellers, although it is often positioned and described as a means of companies protecting their interests, but framing it in this way is largely a 
                marketing strategy to attract users. In the case of Whatsapp being purchased by Facebook, the way in which Facebook, as a company, utilises Whatsapp as a means of collecting 
                even greater amounts of data is a method that, ethically, is difficult to unpack. The purchasing of a widely used communication app and use it to harvest large amounts of data, 
                in addition to the data that is collected through Facebook as a social media platform and still furthermore through other social media apps that they company owns, using it to 
                show you specific ads based on the large pool of data that they have collected and in turn creating this ‘average you’, that Janssens mentions is difficult to escape when 
                everything is so connected. Should you turn off certain settings in one place, there is still a stream of data coming from somewhere else, on you, straight to them. </p>
            </br>
            <p>Janssens mentions the extreme permeation of Google in what seems like, every front, commenting on the extensiveness of their reach and how far their influence goes. They also 
                mention the fact that Google, though capable of collecting the data themselves, still purchases data from hundreds of brokers. </p>
            </br>
            <p>Sets of data can improve the quality of life and even the ways in which we live life, for example, in terms of healthcare, Janssens explains how when prescribing medication, 
                doctors take into consideration the ‘average you’ rather than an ‘average human being’ based on your medical file and those of others. This shows that the collecting of big 
                data could increase life spans or increase the level of comfort at which we live our lives. But, like all things, this possibility is one side of the coin. Janssens states 
                that it an “illusion to think that mankind will only gain more freedom through the possibilities that big data analyses offer,” making it clear that through the illusions of 
                a better future and greater possibilities for the progression of mankind, a greater cost in terms of the freedoms and liberties and agency that we have will have to be paid. 
                It is also made apparent that questions around the ethical choices that have been made and the mistakes that could have taken place are not being asked to which Janssens airs 
                the concern that “people start thinking in terms of the functionality of the system of analyses, not that they no longer question the technology itself.” (Janssens, 2016: pp2)</p>
            </br>
            <p>The implementation of The Internet of Things results in the merging of the material and the digital world. This hyperconnectivity of data flows coupled with the probability 
                analyses associated with this technology could result in a change in terms of the way in which our perceptions of each other as human beings is changed, and will also be 
                structured around data perceptions of people and the ‘average them’. Generated data analyses of people will rely on calculations of probability. </p>
            </br>
            <p>A characteristic of big data is that the data that is collected is not always accurate. This can be attributed to its methodological issues. The responsibility for the 
                accuracy of the data is oftentimes left in the care of the organisations that collect or own the data and in some cases, this responsibility is extended to those who 
                analyse the data. When data is passed from organisation to organisation, re-contextualised, and edited, the responsibility for the accuracy of the data cannot lie with one 
                party. The issues around accountability and responsibility can no longer be pushed back and ignored, especially not when so much of it is implemented into our daily lives. 
                A similar issue arises when many parties work with and only have access to a database in which the data is confidential and has to be stored safely. Janssens explains how the 
                problem of social determinism reveals itself in light of big data analyses have a value of probability over empirical reality.  As people are increasingly viewed or seen 
                through their data profiles, and big data analyses are given the label that these profiles and analyses contain information on reality or truth on ‘the Other’, it brings into 
                question the decisions and actions that can be taken by people on the basis of the outcomes of these analyses. </p>
            </br>
            <h4>Big Data Profiling As a Dystopia </h4>
            </br>
            <p>Social determinism through data profiling implies that people can not be approached as purely biological beings. Through systems of algorithms, big data analyses create an 
                idea of people in reality, but this brings into question the extent of room for the truth outside of these systems. The possibilities that big data analyses create in terms 
                of generating profiles of people raise questions and concerns around the ethical nature of data profiling. Big data analyses have a huge role in terms of our conceptions of 
                reality and the ways in which we experience the world around us, the consequences of such a prominent influence could be the freedom as people were we to go against this 
                system of data profiling. It is conceivable that changes to our conceptions of the other as fellow human beings could have big influences on our interpersonal values and 
                social positions (Janssens, 2016).</p>
