            <h1 style = "text-align: center;"><u><b>Exam: Analysis</b></u></h1>
        </br>
        <p>For the exam, I have done two different graphs, one a “lollipop” graph and the other a pie chart in which the user can change the data set to show two different types of data 
            relating to covid19. I approached these graphs with the intention of observing local statistics and data around covid19, looking at fairly surface-level statistics like the 
            number of active cases, total cases, the number of people who have passed as a result of covid19 and other such data.</p>
        </br>
        <p>When creating these graphs, I was trying to stay within the realm of the theory work we have been covering over the semester especially in terms of readability and context and 
            so on. The purposes of using these graphs and using more or less the same data across all of them was meant to act as a means of experimenting with the ways in which similar 
            to the same data sets can be used and expressed differently. </p>
        </br>
        <p>I was hoping to have more annotations on the graphs, like hovering the mouse over a point/bar/segment and having a box with the information about that portion of the graph 
            displayed for the viewer to see because you cannot properly tell what the values are by just looking at the graph. I could not get it to work unfortunately and had to leave it 
            out. But I think, looking at the graphs that I have made, it is obviously the impact that annotations have on a graph or a visualisation and how important it is to have that 
            information given the viewer. </p>
        </br>
        <p>Looking at the graphs it also becomes evident about how crucial it is to know how to space the data along your axes, having data that is closer together in value should most 
            likely have the values on the axes closer to the lowest and highest values in the dataset so that, in the case of the bar graph, the bar sizes are more exaggerated to fully 
            feel the impact on the data. This same thought process could be applied to the pie chart as well in terms of using colour to clearly distinguish between the segments and having a 
            legend to provide some information because a pie chart with no form of annotations or information is effectively useless.</p>
        </br>
        <p>I did want to include other types of graphs and charts apart from the basic ones that we are all accustomed to but was unable to make it work. Using the pie charts have proven 
            that they are not the best type of graph or chart to use to show certain types of data and that the scope of information that can be given in a pie chart is not sufficient to 
            be able to deduce or infer very much from.</p>
        </br>
        <p>In terms of interactivity, there is a lot more to it than swapping out data sets using a button. Interactivity is meant to carry a lot more weight and create a significant sort 
            of change to the visualisations. In the pie chart, in terms of interactivity, it barely grazes the surface. It’s not substantial enough and still does not provide the viewer 
            with more or additional information.</p>
