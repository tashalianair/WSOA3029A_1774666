            <p>
                Data visualisation is something initially thought to be a tool to “support analytical reasoning” (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007), as seen when used as economic charts or as diagrams performing calculations. In more recent years, data visualisations were used as a tool for military and national security means which, as a practice, has its roots in history when battles and marches would be plotted and even cataloguing and highlighting areas of illness and recovery and the like. 
            </p>
        </br>
            <p>
                In times closer to the present there has been a new breakout of the use of data visualisation, this being the use of it in art or art 
                based data. The techniques used to do this are based on those that are initially explored by the academic community and while when used 
                in art, these techniques might be recognisable by those in the scientific visualisation community, the motives and drives which govern the 
                artist are different. 
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>
                To define what is meant by artistic visualisations is complicated and complex because it, by its very nature would require a definition for 
                art which is another complex and difficult task. Artistic visualisations could be thought of as “visualizations of data done by artists with 
                the intent of making art.” The artworks should be based on actual data and not based on metaphorical data and must not be something that 
                appears to be a visualization or is surface level. The definition should not include the topic of beauty or have a core identifier of artistic 
                visualisation be the notion of beauty. 
            </p>
                </br>
            <p>
                The question of how and why this new type of visualisation or this new style of art has come about is a matter of two factors. The first is 
                the emergence of accessible and easy to use software and technology. Gone are the days of needing a super computer and having to know a variety 
                of coding languages in order to create a data visualisation. Today there are many cheap and easily accessible software that people can use. 
                The second is that data is now far more accessible than before thanks to the Internet, which can be thought of as a huge database all its own. 
                Having these things made accessible to a larger scope of people, has allowed for it to grow and morph into something else.

                <u>Jason Salavon and the Power of Coloured Pixels</u>
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>
                Jason Salavon’s artistic visualisations are described to be works that “confront the viewer with inescapable, pervasive patterns in everyday 
                life” (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007). In one of his artworks titled <i>Homes for Sale</i> Salavon combines a series of images of houses within a 
                particular area that are up for sale, the image is then constructed by taking the mean averaging colour for each photo and placing them, pixel 
                by pixel. The result is a blurred image that holds the vaguest resemblance to a house, the focus of these images being not so much the actual 
                photos of the houses. They appear more like paintings with a haunting atmosphere to them.
            </p>
            </br>
            <p> 
                In another piece titled <i> Class of 1988</i> and <i>Class of 1967</i> they are part of a series “investigating rites of passage – in 
                this case, high school graduation,” (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007) with the intention of exploring the visual ‘mementos’ that are created 
                and established when celebrating such events. He uses the same technique from the <i>Homes for Sale</i> pieces, merging and blending 
                photos together to create a similar effect. Despite the warped appearance, there are certain visuals that stand out and when looking 
                at both sets together, there are commonalities that have remained despite there being a twenty-year gap between the sets of photos.

                <u>Last Clock by Jussi Ängelslevä and Ross Cooper</u>
            </p>
        </br>
            <p>
                Last clock was a commentary on the widespread presence of surveillance cameras in cities and was a means of artists exploring ways of 
                capturing “some of the most evocative aspects of the medium” (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007). The images were constructed to resemble the 
                structure of an analogue clock. Just as an analogue clock has a second hand, a minute hand and an hour hand, the artwork is structured 
                similarly, having the ‘hands’ arranged in concentric circles with the seconds being the outermost circle, the minutes being the middle 
                circle and the hours being the innermost circle. Each of these hands are made from taking slice of a live video feed and as the hands 
                continue to run around the face of the clock they will leave a trace of what the camera is capturing. Despite not being able to have any 
                use towards surveillance or video watching but the visualisation serves to create something of an “emblem of its surroundings”, creating 
                an impactful and “powerful record of time and place” (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007).
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>
                The point at which all these artworks can be distinguished from traditional visualisations is that “each embodies a forceful point of 
                view” (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007). They, according to Viégas and Wattenberg, derive their power from sins of visual analytics that the 
                artists commit in order to create them. Salavon’s work and it’s lack of clarity and sharply defined features “translates into a poetic 
                notion of an archetypal image,” (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007) but despite there being a lack of definition, his technique allows for the 
                highlighting and emphasis of certain features. In the same vein of “distortion in the service of emphasis” (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007), 
                The Last Clock achieves a similar thing.
