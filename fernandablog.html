            <p>
                Data visualisation is something initially thought to be a tool to “support analytical reasoning” (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007), as seen when used as economic charts or as diagrams performing calculations. In more recent years, data visualisations were used as a tool for military and national security means which, as a practice, has its roots in history when battles and marches would be plotted and even cataloguing and highlighting areas of illness and recovery and the like. 
            </p>
        </br>
            <p>
                In times closer to the present there has been a new breakout of the use of data visualisation, this being the use of it in art or art 
                based data. The techniques used to do this are based on those that are initially explored by the academic community and while when used 
                in art, these techniques might be recognisable by those in the scientific visualisation community, the motives and drives which govern the 
                artist are different. 
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>
                To define what is meant by artistic visualisations is complicated and complex because it, by its very nature would require a definition for 
                art which is another complex and difficult task. Artistic visualisations could be thought of as “visualizations of data done by artists with 
                the intent of making art.” The artworks should be based on actual data and not based on metaphorical data and must not be something that 
                appears to be a visualization or is surface level. The definition should not include the topic of beauty or have a core identifier of artistic 
                visualisation be the notion of beauty. 
            </p>
                </br>
            <p>
                The question of how and why this new type of visualisation or this new style of art has come about is a matter of two factors. The first is 
                the emergence of accessible and easy to use software and technology. Gone are the days of needing a super computer and having to know a variety 
                of coding languages in order to create a data visualisation. Today there are many cheap and easily accessible software that people can use. 
                The second is that data is now far more accessible than before thanks to the Internet, which can be thought of as a huge database all its own. 
                Having these things made accessible to a larger scope of people, has allowed for it to grow and morph into something else.
