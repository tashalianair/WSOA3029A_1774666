            <h1 style = "text-align: center;"><u><b>Kidd: Representation</b></u></h1>
            <p>In the first chapter titled <i>Theories of Representation,</i> author Jenny Kidd seeks to introduce a set of discourses on representation, 
                namely “Representation and reality; representation and myth; representation and visual culture; representation as persuasion; and representation 
                and identity politics.” (Kidd, 2015 pp:18). Kidd states that it is imperative to understand that representation is very much, a man made part of 
                life and that it is crucial in the construction of “identities, cultures, communities and in the articulation of difference,” (Kidd, 2015 pp:19)</p>
            <p>In the first section, representation and reality, Kidd makes it clear that representation is closely linked to the construction of meaning. There 
                is a link that then exists between this and the theory of semiology and ways in which signs and codes are used in the construction of reality 
                within the media and the texts that we consume. Daniel Chandler remarks that a text can be a combination or an “assemblage of signs” that can be 
                presented in ways that extend beyond the written word, like images, sounds, and gestures. Kidd notes that the assemblage of signs is of importance, 
                as is the ways in which we assign meaning to them.</p>
            </br>
            <p> Kidd accredits the theory behind semiotics to Ferdinand de Saussure and Charles Sanders Pierce. Semiotics is based on the “understanding that the words, 
                language and signs,” (Kidd, 2015 pp 20) that is used in the everyday life and the social contexts of anyone that will then go on to shape our realities. 
                Kidd explains that this has become revolutionary because it implies that signs are responsible for shaping our realities as opposed to the idea that they 
                merely reflect a pre-existing reality. It is the concept of language that “creates our concepts of reality rather than reality existing before language gives 
                words to it.” (Kidd, 2015 pp 20). This is done by the assigning of linguistic signs to represent something, in which these signs by no means represent any 
                resemblance to the thing that they represent but for it to exist as a place holder in our minds or act as some sort of reference point for people who speak 
                the same language to. For example, the word ‘door’ and an actual door, bear no resemblance or similarity to each other. According to Ferdinand de Saussure’s 
                theory, the sign is formed when the signifier and the signified are put together. Kidd references Charles Sanders Pierce by explaining that the signs that we
                 think with and interact with are meaningless until a meaning or association is assigned to them. </p>
                </br>
            <p>Marcel Danesi states that representation can be “characterised as the process of constructing a form X to call attention to something that exists either
                 materially or conceptually as Y” (ref). Kidd explains that representation is not as straight forward as Danesi would have it. Whoever is responsible for the 
                 creation or the construction of ‘X’ has some sort of intention or is from some social or historical context that will impact the meaning of ‘X’ and the ways 
                 in which it will be used and the functions and purposes it will continue to have. This in contrast with Ferdinand de Saussure’s theory, the connections that 
                 is formed between what is represented and what and how it is represented is arbitrary but are dependent on context and social and cultural cues (Kidd, 2015). 
                 He also states that something’s meaning is relative to its difference, for example, the word-sign ‘table’ only has meaning because you are able to differentiate 
                 it from words like ‘chair’ or ‘lamp’ and without having this difference or being able to differentiate it from other things, it would not be able to function 
                 as a sign. It is also noted that in Ferdinand de Saussure’s theories, concepts “are defined not positively, in their likeness to one another, but negatively, 
                 in contrast” (Kidd, 2015 pp 21).</p>
                </br>
            <p>In media, there is focus on what systems are in place to give words, images, reports, films, and other things like memes meanings and how they are then 
                differentiated from the others. There is an interest in codes and the ways in which signs are grouped together and how these codes construct meaning, 
                especially to those who are interested in culture, dress codes, genre codes, typologies in music, films, and graphic novels.  Kidd makes the example of 
                genre in music by referring to pop music and how there are certain codes that exist in pop music that are not shared in rock or trap. Another interesting 
                example made is that of tattooing and how there are so many variations in terms of the cultures that surround tattooing whether it be cultural identity, military 
                experience, gang affiliations, music, religious identities as well and these are represented through symbols that ‘outsiders’ or people who have no knowledge or 
                have not shared in these experiences would not know. </p>
            </br>
            <p>Kidd emphasises that the decisions that go into the signs we create and the codes we use matter. That these signs and their connotations and their meanings are 
                “charges with ideology, invested with power, markers of difference, and carriers of ‘value’.”. These signs are able to create versions of reality and have the 
                ability to present some things as logical and natural. They have the power to establish what is true and what is false, what makes sense and what does not, 
                what is right and what is wrong. Kidd states that in an age where people make and distribute their own media and where representation and self-representation 
                have become ubiquitous, this kind of literacy is crucial to navigating the world and the media and the signs and codes that make it so. </p>
            </br>
            <p>In the second section titles<i> representation and…myth, </i>Kidd draws on Roland Barthes theory of semiotics and more importantly, myths. Barthes was interested 
                in the relationship between what is seen and what is understood as well as the distinctions between what he referred to as the denotations and the connotations in 
                any given text. Kidd uses the Apple logo to convey an explanation on the distinction between connotation and denotation. At a denotative level, the logo could be 
                said to simply represent an apple but because there are so many associations with that particular representation of the apple, with the brand Apple, it begins to 
                mean more. Apple products are viewed and thought of as something to be desired, a luxury and are meant for people who are “ahead of the curve”. These are the 
                connotations that are associated with the brand and by extension, the logo. These are, however, not the only connotations that are linked to the brand or those who use it. 
                This is the myth that was created about the brand, its products as well as those who use it. </p>
            </br>
            <p>Connotations are created and informed by social and cultural experiences and knowledge and are then reflected in media, this is what Barthes calls this “the bringing together of 
                signs and their connotations to create the myth. Barthes expresses that these myths have become naturalised, taken to be common-sense or intuitive and this is where their power 
                lies. Kidd explains that the study of mythology has become a means of identifying these signs, the ways they are built into codes and analysing how the structures work to 
                communicate specific messages, indicating the ways in which ideology works its way into the creation of media, and how they can “be involved in a process of naturalising or 
                normalising certain messages, and neutralising others.”. </p>
            </br>
            <p>In the third section,<i> representation and…visual communication, </i>deals with visual communication, which is understood as ambiguous, suggestive and open to a variety of 
                interpretations, more so than other forms and methods of communication due to the codes and the language used are not explicitly stated, best put by Jostein Gripsrud, 
                “images are composed of elements that are not as clearly distinguished as the word-signs of verbal language. The meanings of images are therefore often unclear, fleeting or 
                plural.”. Kidd refers to Machin and Mayer, stating they make suggestions on how people think about connotative functions in images, stating the more abstract an image, the 
                more prominent the connotative communicative purpose and that whether the communicative purpose of an image is denotative or connotative is determined by the context and 
                that the connotative meanings of images might seem like something born of fee association or agency but it was designed by people with a particular target market in mind 
                with the belief that those people will be able to understand the message they are trying to communicate. </p>
            </br>
            <p>Kidd emphasises that when analysing any media, context is everything. One should take into account where an image is placed to be seen, they compare the difference between a 
                portrait hung in a gallery and one held in a locket and how the way that these portraits are placed impact the way in which people will interact with and respond to it. The 
                next type of context Kidd mentions is the context of the production, how something was created and the circumstances around that creation. For example, the release of the new 
                live-action Mulan movie lead to a multitude of negative responses for a number of reasons. One of those reasons was that people chose to boycott the movie after it was revealed 
                that the filming for the film too place in the same place or close to the same place in which the Chinese government is allegedly holding Uyghur Muslims in concentration camps. 
                The context surrounding the production of the film is what has altered and changed the way people have perceived the film. Historical context and having knowledge around the 
                historical moment around which something was produced is another branch of context that Kidd focuses on. Kidd uses the example of Oscar Pistorius and how images of him were once 
                hailed as representations of triumph and success and someone that people ought to be proud of, however, after his trial and imprisonment, the meanings behind those pictures have 
                been altered and the way in which we now read and engage with that media greatly differs. </p>
            </br>
            <p>Looking at an image in the context of other images is also important when discussing context. Looking at an image as part of a whole, for example an art exhibition, where each 
                piece enforces another and how works that are placed among others can no longer stand alone and exist purely removed from others. A common example is that of a newspaper and 
                how an image placed in an article cannot be viewed objectively and removed from the article because of the context that it forms part of. </p>
            </br>
            <p>The relationship between photography and the creating of reality is an interesting one to say the least. The photographer will always be in a position to frame what they see 
                in a certain way to create a particular perspective whether that is what actually happened or not and regardless of what preceded or happened after the picture was taken. 
                The reproductivity of photographs has increased so drastically in recent years, especially since the birth of the internet and social media that there seems to be nothing 
                special about a photo anymore. Kidd quotes Walter Benjamin, who speaks on the aura of something stating “Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in 
                one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be’. Benjamin explains how with each reproduction of a piece of art, in 
                this case with every reproduction of a photo, there is something inherently unique that is lost, there is a unique existence that is removed once something goes into 
                mass reproduction. </p>
            </br>
            <p>With the concept of photography, we are reminded that representational texts are constructed, they assist in the act of shaping reality within a certain frame. Kidd mentions 
                data visualisations and how these are now a core staple of news media and can be found in papers, periodicals, television and a variety of others but more importantly, 
                the web where their means of representation are now changed and how they are can be animated and or interactive. Data visualisation helps to, in a simple format that is 
                easy to digest and works effectively to communicate a variety of data in different ways; through charts and graphs and images and scales and so on. It is a means of being 
                able to provide and communicate data in more aesthetically pleasing formats. However, as aesthetically pleasing as it may be, there is still a way in which it could be done in 
                which there is still far too much data that cannot be absorbed or understood and as a result, reinforces the notions of unreachable information and knowledge. </p>
            </br>
            <p>In the fourth section,<i> representation as…persuasion, </i>Kidd speaks to advertising and its ever-present existence in our everyday lives. Despite being constantly shown everywhere, 
                there is always a distinct lack of specificity when it comes to advertisements. They never truly show the details of people’s lives but seem to be more inclined with glossing over and 
                creating broad generalisations. Adverts are often associated with values of capitalist consumerism, globalisation and the market but very rarely associated with being considered a form of 
                artistic output. Despite the negative connotations that come with advertisements, they permeate a lot of our lives, from the things that we say, our interests, our desires and the ways in 
                which we express ourselves.</p>
            </br>
            <p>In the final section<i> representation and…identity politics </i>Kidd states that there exists a frustrated relationship between representation and reality. “Social order is not a given 
                or natural state; it is constructed practically and represented symbolically, and media representations of the ‘order’ of social life help enact and perform that order.”, is a quote that 
                Kidd uses to examine the very constructed nature of what is considered to be socially acceptable and that these representations are more than likely are always something political. To say 
                that something is political is to say that it can never be presented or seen as neutral. The ways in which we perceive objects can change, Kidd uses the example of the umbrella and how the 
                way that umbrellas were perceived were altered after the Hong Kong ‘Umbrella Revolution’, becoming a symbol of protest and revolution and not some common place item used to shelter you from 
                the rain. </p>
            </br>
            <p>Kidd notes how representations regarding race, gender, class, sexuality and disability have always been problematic which is something that, although practiced virtually everywhere, is still 
                done in the West, a place considered to be the standard especially when it comes to media. The overplayed and over-represented white, middle-class, hetero-normative, cis-gendered, male 
                perspective within media is to be found in both within the media as well as behind the scenes in terms of the production of media. The distinct lack of representation of anyone who does 
                not fit within those parameters has always been something that has existed in the media that circulates and if anyone from any marginalised group is representation they are often done so in 
                poor taste, tokenised and created so their roles will always be in service of the white male, central figure.<p>
