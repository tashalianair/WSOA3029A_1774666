                "Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance
                between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the 
                Avatar mastered all four elements. Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A
                hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the War. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed
                to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after out tribe. Some people believe that
                the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads, and that the cycle is broken. But I haven't lost hope. I still believe that somehow, the
                Avatar will return to save the world"

                "A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And Although his airbending skillls after
                great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world"

                Hot take: Katara was just a kid who had an unbearabele amount of pressure put on her at a young age and does not deserve all the hate she
                gets. She might have spoken about losing her mother more than her brother but Sokka was also an emotional constipated teenage boy who hated
                expressing any kind of weakness because he wanted to be seen as a 'man' by his father and expressing any kind of emotion that wasn't associated
                with strength was a bad thing for him. They were both dealing with the pressures of their lives in the wake of their mother's death and the War
                differently and that doesn't mean anyone should bully them because of it.
